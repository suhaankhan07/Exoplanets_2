For satellite missions, NASA needs to be able to process tons and tons of information received by satellites efficiently and effectively. We'll see one approach as to help NASA classify exoplanet stars by using modern machine learning techniques! How better to learn than use raw data from one of NASA's satellites?

The focus of this notebook is classifying exoplanet stars. We'll be:

Preprocessing the dataset for the ML models
Implementing different ML architectures to see which one performs best
Using data augmentation to improve our models' performance!
